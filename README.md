# appium-runner

A Linux GUI (Windows and MacOSX are also supported) for Appium. Project is written in Python using PyQt4 for GUI. For now hasn't much functionality compared to appium.app or appium.exe, but the core basics are there.

A pretty descriptive screenshot below should 'tell' you what it does and what does not.
